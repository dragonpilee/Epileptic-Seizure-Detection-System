## üß† Introduction

Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures, affecting millions of people worldwide. Early detection and diagnosis of epileptic seizures are crucial for effective treatment and management. EEG signals, which measure electrical activity in the brain, provide valuable information for diagnosing epilepsy.

This project leverages machine learning and signal processing techniques to develop a reliable and efficient system for detecting epileptic seizures using EEG data. By analyzing EEG recordings, the system can differentiate between seizure and non-seizure activity, facilitating timely intervention and medical assistance.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement

The visual inspection of EEG signals for epileptic seizure detection is time-consuming and subject to human error. Automated methods for detecting seizures in EEG data can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of diagnosis. This project addresses the need for a robust, automated system that can accurately identify epileptic seizure activity in EEG recordings.

## üìä Dataset

The project utilizes the Bonn University EEG dataset, which consists of EEG recordings from subjects with and without epileptic seizures. The dataset contains multiple classes representing different types of EEG activity, with a focus on distinguishing seizure activity from non-seizure activity.
